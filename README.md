# TicTacToe

TicTacToe Game built using SwiftUI.

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players X and O on a 3 x 3 grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:
 
 - Players take turns placing characters into empty squares '  '.
 - The first player always places 'X' character, while the second player always places 'O' character.
 - 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
 - The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
 - The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
 - No more moves can be played if the game is over.
 - The grid resets once the game is over
 - An Alert displays the outcome of the game.
